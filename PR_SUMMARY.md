# Enhanced Multi-Language Security Analysis

This PR significantly improves the scanner's capabilities for detecting vulnerabilities across multiple programming languages, with a focus on comprehensive detection patterns and expanded test coverage.

## Changes Summary

### Enhanced Language Support
- **C# Analysis**: Added robust pattern detection for SQL injection, command injection, path traversal, XXE, CSRF, unsafe deserialization, and open redirect vulnerabilities
- **Python Analysis**: Improved vulnerability detection for SQL injection, command injection, path traversal, unsafe framework usage, and template injection vulnerabilities
- **Java Analysis**: Enhanced detection for JDBC vulnerabilities, command execution issues, XXE flaws, and deserialization vulnerabilities

### Testing Improvements
- Added comprehensive test files for the DependencyChecker module
- Added extensive tests for the SecurityAuditor class
- Created detailed test suites for the RuntimeAnalyzer to validate execution context and sandboxing
- Added test coverage for dynamic analysis capabilities across all supported languages
- Fixed TypeScript type annotations in test files

### Documentation Updates
- Added detailed multi-language support section to README.md
- Documented vulnerability types detected for each language
- Enhanced configuration examples 
- Added troubleshooting section for common issues

### Code Quality
- Fixed various TypeScript errors in security-auditor.ts
- Improved interface consistency between classes
- Enhanced error handling in dynamic analysis components
- Fixed type compatibility issues in the DynamicAnalyzer

## Testing Done
- Verified all enhanced language pattern detection against sample vulnerable code
- Validated that the C# analyzer correctly identifies vulnerabilities and provides remediation advice
- Verified that safe code patterns don't trigger false positives
- Ran the test suite to ensure new features don't break existing functionality

## Next Steps
Some minor issues still remain:
- Several failing tests in the security-auditor due to fs module mocking issues
- Some type definition inconsistencies in scanner.ts
- Improvements needed for dynamic analysis runtime simulation

These will be addressed in a subsequent PR.
